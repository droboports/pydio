<p>During the first access <?php echo $appname; ?> will ask information to configure itself. This information includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An admin account name and password. Please choose a strong password, especially if <?php echo $appname; ?> will be exposed to the internet.</li>
  <li>Some global options. It is safe to leave these options as they are.</li>
  <li>Storage configuration. For small deployments, please choose storage type &quot;Database&quot;, and select database &quot;Sqlite 3&quot;. Click &quot;Try connecting to the database&quot; and make sure you get a green alert indicating &quot;Connection established!&quot;.</li>
  <li>Optionally include some additional users. This can be done later in <?php echo $appname; ?>.</li>
</ul>
